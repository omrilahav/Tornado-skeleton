This is a skeleton of Tornado Web Server written in Python.
(http://www.tornadoweb.org)

It is a full architecture (Service Layer, Business Layer, Data Layer)
including web-sockets support.

Although haven't been tested,
this is the skeleton of a great big project that works great.

if you find any bugs or have any question,
DO NOT hesitate to send me an email: omrilahav@hotmail.com

Enjoy :)

p.s. I used some other open-source libraries in order to
create this skeleton, so big thanks for all of them
(I wish I could remember or find the sources so I could put some links to it).
